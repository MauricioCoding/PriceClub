!!This project is a Ecommerce application wich focuses in tools like postgres and docker to set up a backend in one image and a frontend in a separated image!!
As a developer i believe this can be helpfull if we want to connect the frontend to different types of backend systems.
Also the project stills needs a couple tweeks examples
-Tables and data being created when running the docker compose build command
-Adding users
Small tweeks that will be added in a couple days
